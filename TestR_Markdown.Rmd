Going to load some data.

```{r}
#Set directory 
setwd ("C:/Users/Charlotte/Documents/GitHub/ReproduceDataWeek2")
library (datasets)
#load data from directory
DataFrame <- read.csv( "activity.csv")
summary (DataFrame)
```

Here is a simple plot of the data
```{r}
plot(DataFrame)
```


Here is a regression model
#```{r}
#library(stats)
#fit <- lm (steps - date + interval, data = DataFrame)
##summary (fit)

```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
